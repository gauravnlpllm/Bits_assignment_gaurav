The formation of black holes is a complex process that involves the collapse of massive stars under their own gravity. Here's a brief overview:\n\nBlack holes are created when a massive star, typically with a mass at least three times that of the sun, undergoes a supernova explosion at the end of its life cycle. During this explosion, the star's core collapses, causing a massive amount of matter to be compressed into an incredibly small region, known as a singularity.\n\nAs the core collapses, the star's density and gravity increase exponentially, causing a boundary to form around the singularity, known as the event horizon. The event horizon marks the point of no return, beyond which anything that enters, including light, cannot escape the gravitational pull of the black hole.\n\nThe process of black hole formation is governed by Einstein's theory of general relativity, which predicts that massive objects warp the fabric of spacetime around them. The more massive the object, the stronger the gravitational pull, and the more spacetime is curved.\n\nIn the case of a black hole, the curvature of spacetime is so extreme that it creates a gravitational well that traps everything, including light, within its event horizon.
